                        My name is Andrea Calderon. The first video game I played was Mortal Kombat on arcade machines
                        at the mall. That made me
                        develop a love for video games and martial arts that I have still today. Gamer Vines is aimed at
                        people that enjoy video
                        games and want to develop a sense of community. I am a biologist, animal lover, tree hugger, and
                        my objectives are
                        bringing more women into STEM careers and to transform McDonald's into the largest vegan fast
                        food restaurant chain in
                        the world by 2030.
